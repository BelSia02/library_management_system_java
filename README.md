# Java Library Management System

A simple Library Management System built using Java to demonstrate
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and basic system design.

## Features
- Add, update, and delete books and users
- Search for books
- User management (Librarian / Student)
- Menu-based console system

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
3. Locate and run the `RoleSelection.java` file.

## User Login
- Users log in by entering a user ID.
- User ID format:
  - Librarian: `L` followed by 3 digits (e.g. `L001`)
  - Student: `S` followed by 3 digits (e.g. `S001`)
- Several default users are provided for testing purposes.

## Performance Test
- The `PerformanceTest.java` file is used to test the runtime performance of the system.
- It measures execution time for selected operations.
- Run this file separately to evaluate performance behavior.

## Program Entry Point
- Main system entry: `RoleSelection.java`
- Performance testing entry: `PerformanceTest.java`
